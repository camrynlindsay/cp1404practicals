# Practical 07

## About My Repo and Me
This repo "CP1404practicals" is where my practicals for programming subject CP1404 are created and completed. 
I am a first year education student, however one of my teaching areas is ICT, which is why I'm enrolled in CP1404. 
I have not done any previous coding prior to this year. 

## Lesson I've Learned about "Clean Code" in CP1404
* Always close a file after opening it to avoid errors such as losing data or not seeing any changes to the file
until the program is told to close the file.
* Line up functions chronologically unless it can be paired together (i.e. opening and closing file functions) 
for better code readability.
* Always commit at significant changes (small milestones) and use imperative mood when naming meaningful commits.
