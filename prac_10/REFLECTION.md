# Reflection

## Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

I admit that in later practicals, I forgot to add my time estimates. However, when I did add them, I was under or
on the estimated time majority of the time with one or two programs going slightly over. I think it improved a little bit
over the weeks but not significantly. 

## Regarding the code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

Yes, while I believe I learned more when I have been reviewed than doing reviews, the code reviews have helped
me alot during this subject's practicals. By being reviewed by peers, I try to make sure to be as concise as I
can be, with suggestions like adding comments to explain import statements and removing redundant code from 
my programs. 

## Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would change Prac 8 or the Kivy prac by extending it to provide students with more opportunities to 
gain experience in creating GUI programs. This additional practice would be particularly beneficial 
for Assignment 2, given that students could access more of the work they did in the prac and the feedback 
they got to improve it for the assignment.
